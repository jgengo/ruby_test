Please write a ruby script which translate arabic numerals into english numerals.

It should be like

```ruby
$ ruby arabic2english.rb 1
one

$ ruby arabic2english.rb 11
eleven

$ ruby arabic2english.rb 100
one hundred
```

Please implement it with [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) so the result should consist of the git commits of a new failed test, a code change to pass the failed test, and refactoring.
